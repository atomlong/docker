# docker
A collection of docker files and configurations for my home server setup (using a Raspberry Pi 4).

Currently I use the following services:

  * Gitea
  * Nextcloud (with nginx and redis)
  * traefik v2 reverse proxy

The containers can either be started using the shell script or docker-compose.
